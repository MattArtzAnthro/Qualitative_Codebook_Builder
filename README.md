## What This Tool Does

This notebook extracts and develops research codebooks from source materials (academic articles, reports, methodology guides) following established methodological best practices. Instead of manually reading through dozens of papers to identify theoretical constructs and build coding frameworks, you receive a structured, codebook with definitions, criteria, and examples extracted from your literature.

The system analyzes your source documents and creates a maximum of 40 codes to prevent cognitive overload, with each code including comprehensive definitions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and supporting examples from the original texts.

## Key Features for Anthropological Research

1. **Multi-Format Document Support**: PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, RTF, XLSX, CSV file processing
2. **Theory-Guided Extraction**: Implements inductive, deductive, and hybrid coding approaches
3. **Quality Assurance Framework**: Built-in validation and conceptual distinctness assessment
4. **Semantic Versioning**: Full version control with changelog tracking
5. **Multiple Export Formats**: CSV, JSON, Markdown, ATLAS.ti, NVivo compatible outputs
6. **Methodological Rigor**: Following established best practices for codebook development
7. **Interactive Configuration**: Adjustable parameters for different research approaches

## Workflow

1. **Configure Parameters**: Set extraction approach (inductive/deductive/hybrid), quality thresholds, and processing preferences
2. **Upload Source Documents**: Process academic articles, reports, and methodology guides in multiple formats
3. **Automated Code Extraction**: AI analysis identifies theoretical constructs, methodological approaches, and key concepts
4. **Quality Refinement**: Merge similar codes, validate definitions, and ensure conceptual distinctness
5. **Export Documentation**: Generate codebooks in multiple formats with usage guidelines and quality reports

## Applications in Anthropological Practice

This tool supports any research requiring content analysis—from dissertation fieldwork to applied research projects. It's particularly useful for computational analysis using the tools in my AI Anthropology Toolkit, comparative studies requiring standardized coding frameworks, and collaborative research where multiple team members need consistent theoretical foundations.

## Methodological Positioning

This tool represents a **computational anthropology** approach—using AI to enhance rather than replace traditional literature review and codebook development. The extraction preserves the theoretical rigor that defines anthropological inquiry while addressing the practical challenges of analyzing large bodies of literature.

**Important**: This tool extracts codes from source documents but does not apply them to research data.

## Target Audience

Designed for anthropologists and qualitative researchers developing coding frameworks—from graduate students building dissertation codebooks to research teams requiring standardized theoretical foundations for large-scale studies.

## Technical Approach

The system employs **semantic analysis and natural language processing** to identify theoretical constructs and methodological approaches within academic literature. Using configurable extraction approaches, it systematically processes documents to build comprehensive codebooks while maintaining quality through similarity detection, validation checks, and conceptual distinctness assessment.

## Contributing to AI Anthropology

This notebook contributes to the emerging field of AI Anthropology—which combines studying AI as cultural artifact, using AI to enhance ethnographic research, and applying anthropological insights to AI development (Artz, forthcoming). By open-sourcing these tools, this work advances the collective capacity of anthropologists to work effectively with computational methods.

## AI Anthropology Toolkit

This tool is part of a growing suite of computational resources for anthropological research:

- **[Interview Transcript Semantic Chunker](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Interview_Transcript_Semantic_Chunker)** - AI-assisted segmentation of interview transcripts
- **[Qualitative Codebook Builder](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Qualitative_Codebook_Builder)** (this tool) - AI-assisted development of qualitative coding frameworks

*Additional tools will be added to this toolkit as they are developed.*
