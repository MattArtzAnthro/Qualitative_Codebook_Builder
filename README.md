# Qualitative Codebook Builder

A Jupyter Notebook for generating qualitative codebooks from unstructured textual data using LLM-assisted methods.

---

## About

This project bridges anthropology and computation by providing a semi-automated process for building qualitative codebooks. It begins with text preprocessing and segmentation, then uses a large language model to suggest descriptive codes and definitions. The output includes a structured codebook and a quality report, allowing for further review, refinement, and reuse across studies.

Designed with techno-anthropology in mind, this tool supports researchers aiming to incorporate computational methods into their qualitative workflows while retaining human interpretive oversight.
