# Qualitative Codebook Builder

A Jupyter Notebook for generating qualitative codebooks from unstructured textual data using LLM-assisted methods.

---

## About

This notebook implements a system for extracting and developing research codebooks from source materials (academic articles, reports, methodology guides) following established methodological best practices. The system extracts theoretical constructs, methodological approaches, and key concepts to build a codebook suitable for peer review.

Designed with techno-anthropology in mind, this tool supports researchers aiming to incorporate computational methods into their qualitative workflows while retaining human interpretive oversight.
